# handboken.rasbat.se

This is a Swedish website meant to teach a little bit about things I like.

Built with Ruby.
To work on this locally you may execute the following commands:

```sh
$ bundle install            # install the gems
$ bundle exec nanoc         # compile the code
$ bundle exec nanoc view    # (windows) serve it locally
$ bundle exec nanoc live    # (*nix) serve it locally
```
